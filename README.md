# Canadian Computing Competition

These are my solutions to the [CCC][] problems, written in Clojure.

[CCC]: http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html

## Usage

These solutions do not parse input strings, so this project is not meant to be compiled. Each solution has a main function which accepts Clojure data structures as input. To run a solution against a particular test case, use the REPL.
